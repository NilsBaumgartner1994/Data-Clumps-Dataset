# Data Clumps Dataset

## Overview
Welcome to the Data Clumps Dataset repository, a comprehensive collection designed for research purposes. This repository hosts a curated set of projects analyzed for data clumps, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

Each project within the `Projects` directory contains its own set of tags, encapsulating the unique aspects of data clumps found within that project.

## Data Clumps Report Format
To understand the format of the data clumps report, please refer to our detailed definition [data-clumps-type-context](https://github.com/FireboltCasters/data-clumps-type-context). This guide provides the necessary context and types of data clumps that we have identified in our research.

## Collected Projects
We have collected and analyzed the following projects for data clumps:
- argouml
- caffeine
- dolphinescheduler
- jflex
- jfreechart
- rocketmq
- xerces2-j

Each project offers a unique perspective and contributes significantly to our understanding of data clumps in software development.

## Research Applications
This repository is an essential resource for research on data clumps. It can be utilized to explore various open questions in the field, such as:
- Prioritizing data clumps by severity
- Analyzing the correlation between data clumps and bugs
- Developing new methodologies for detecting and resolving data clumps
- Understanding the impact of data clumps on software maintainability and performance
