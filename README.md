# Data Clumps Dataset

## Overview
Welcome to the Data Clumps Dataset repository, a comprehensive collection designed for research purposes. This repository hosts a curated set of projects analyzed for data clumps, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

Each project within the `Projects` directory contains its own set of tags, encapsulating the unique aspects of data clumps found within that project.

## Data Clumps Report Format
To understand the format of the data clumps report, please refer to our detailed definition [data-clumps-type-context](https://github.com/FireboltCasters/data-clumps-type-context). This guide provides the necessary context and types of data clumps that we have identified in our research.

## Collected Projects
We have collected and analyzed the following projects for data clumps:
- Android-Universal-Image-Loader
- BroadleafCommerce
- antlr4
- argouml
- caffeine
- ceylon-ide-eclipse
- dolphinscheduler
- elasticsearch
- hazelcast
- jflex

- junit4
- junit5
- mapdb
- mcMMO
- neo4j
- netty
- orientdb
- oryx
- rocketmq
